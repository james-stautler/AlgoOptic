THE MAKE FILE IS ALREADY CREATED:

To compile and link simply run:

make

Then run:

./main

To clear all output files:

make clean

TO CHANGE SETTINGS IN THE MAKE FILE:

To compile the C++ file:

g++ -c "filename.cpp"


To link the file to corresponding libraries:

g++ "filename.o" -o "filename" -lsfml-x

where x can be system, graphics, window, audio, and/or network.

For example:

g++ main.o -o main -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system


Finally, to run the program:

./filename
